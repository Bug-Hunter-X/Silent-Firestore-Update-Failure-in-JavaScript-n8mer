The issue stems from the asynchronous nature of Firebase operations coupled with improper error handling.  Specifically, when attempting to update a document in Firestore using `set()` or `update()`, the promise returned might be ignored, leading to silent failures.  This is particularly problematic when the update depends on the result of a prior operation, creating a chain of asynchronous calls where an error in one link silently propagates without notification.  My code lacked `.catch()` blocks to properly handle rejections, resulting in no visible indication of failure, making debugging difficult.
