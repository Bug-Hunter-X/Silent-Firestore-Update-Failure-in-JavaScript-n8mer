# Silent Firestore Update Failure

This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase Firestore interactions: silent failures due to insufficient error handling in asynchronous JavaScript code.  The `bug.js` file shows the flawed implementation, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.

The problem arises when chained asynchronous operations are used without properly handling potential rejections.  Errors in one part of the chain may silently propagate without providing any feedback to the user or developer, making debugging difficult.  The solution emphasizes the importance of consistently using `.catch()` blocks to detect and handle errors at each step of the asynchronous chain.

This example focuses on Firestore updates, but the concept applies broadly to other asynchronous Firebase operations.
